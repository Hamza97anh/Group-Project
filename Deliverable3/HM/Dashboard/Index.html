              The Goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict the probeblity of an individual having a mental disorder in the tech industry.
              The model uses data pulled from the Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI)'s surveys from the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. 
              Each survy includes a vast array of questions regarding not only potential causal factors that may lead to mental disorders, 
              but also some quality of life issues that workers in the tech industry are facing today.

                  Our Age groups were divided into 5 seperate bins that we perceived to be within the same stage in their life.
                  16-23 for example would be college students likely working as interns at these tech companies.
                  24-30 are the fresh grads who are just starting their life and getting into their first jobs post grad.
                  Beyond that, were looking at more seasoned veterends in the industry who likley have higher positions then their younger 
                  colleagues. They would likely be family men and women. Gender gave us a 0.577 accuracy score based on our model.

                  Much like the Age Column, we binned the company size into commonly understood number figures that most people would understand
                  A company less then 5 would be either startup ventures or small contractor teams that larger companies would higher.
                  Above that we would start to look at small local businesses to city-wide, state-wide, National, then international fourtune 500 companies in that order. 
                  Company size gave a negligable accuracy score so we chose to omit.

                  This test took dividing up the entire sheet of people into two catagories of those who do have a mental illness vs those who don't
                  Then of the yes and no catagories we then we included if these individual have a family history of mental health disorders. 
                  We right way can see that Those who have a mental health disorder and have a family of it make up a larger portion.
                  Our Model produced the strongest result for this data at 0.63 Accuracy score.
