# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
We will be using Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
Sklearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We will be splitting our data into training and testing and
logistic regression to predict the outcome.
