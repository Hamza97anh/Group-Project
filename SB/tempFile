## Presentation
Topic: Determining depression or a specific mental illness in individuals working in Tech

-	Within our team we have some knowledge and interest in behavioral sciences. We originally
wanted to determine if a college student has depression based on their major of study. We 
quickly learned that kind of data was not attainable and started searching for a different 
data set still involving depression. We found a data set involving mental illness in the 
Tech industry and found that even more interesting than our original topic.
-	We found our data set through Kaggle, titled “Mental Health in the Tech Industry.” This 
data set has three different tables combined into one sqlite file. The Answer table has 
four columns, Answer ID, Survey ID, User ID, Question ID, and 273 thousand rows. The Question 
table has two columns, Question ID, and Question Text. The Survey table has Survey ID and 
Description of the survey. 
-	With this data we hope to build a machine learning model that will determine if an 
individual in the Tech industry has a mental illness. We do not know if we want to determine 
depression in an individual or if we want to determine which mental illness from a list of 
anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, etc. in the mental illnesses in the data.
