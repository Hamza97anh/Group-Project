# Mental Health Machine Learning 

## Presentation
Topic: Determining the presence of a mental health disorder or a specific mental illness in individuals working in Tech

-	Within our team we have some knowledge and interest in behavioral sciences. We originally
wanted to determine if a college student has depression based on their major of study. We 
quickly learned that kind of data was not attainable and started searching for a different 
data set still involving depression. We found a data set involving mental illness in the 
Tech industry and found that even more interesting than our original topic.
-	We found our data set through Kaggle, titled “OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey 2016.” This 
data set has 63 columns and 1434 rows of data from a survey about mental health in the Tech
industry.
-	With this data we hope to build a machine learning model that will determine if an 
individual in the Tech industry has a mental illness. We do not know if we want to determine 
depression in an individual or if we want to determine which mental illness from a list of 
anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, etc. in the mental illnesses in the data.

## Machine Learning Model
Python will be used to read in the data
- If we choose to determine depression, a supervised learning model or deep learning neural
network will be the best model to use because our data set has labeled data and a single outcome.
After converting the mental illness to a binary outcome we can use the logistic regression 
algorithm to predict the outcome.
- If we choose to determine any mental illness within individuals who work in Tech, a supervised
learning or neural network would also be more suitable for the question we are asking.

## Communication
Communication has been through zoom on Tuesdays and Thursdays 7:30 pm till 9:00 pm and though
slack in a group message among the four team members. Each meeting we decide what needs to be
done by the next meeting and if we have any questions they go into the slack group message.
