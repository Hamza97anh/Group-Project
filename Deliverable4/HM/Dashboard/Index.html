              The Goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict the probeblity of an individual having a mental disorder in the tech industry.
              The model uses data pulled from the Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI)'s surveys from the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. 
              Each survy includes a vast array of questions regarding not only potential causal factors that may lead to mental disorders, 
              but also some quality of life issues that workers in the tech industry are facing today.

              We chose a logistic regression for our machine learning model as our desired dependent variable output is categorical and binary: 
              whether or not a variable can predict the presence of a mental health disorder diagnosis for individuals in the tech industry (1 or 0).
              Such a model has the potential to provide correlations that could significantly impact the understanding of mental health disorders as they relate to the tech industry. 
              However, we are also limited by the binary output of the algorithm. There are many different mental health disorders and providing only a yes or no output does not fully capture the story. 
              If we had more time, we would have loved to attempt a multiple categorical output regression that is able to predict which mental health disorder an individual in the tech industry might have been diagnosed with.
              This could prove to be very beneficial in determining what potentially causes such disorders with employees in the tech industry.

                  Our Age groups were divided into 5 seperate bins that we perceived to be within the same stage in their life.
                  16-23 for example would be college students likely working as interns at these tech companies.
                  24-30 are the fresh grads who are just starting their life and getting into their first jobs post grad.
                  Beyond that, were looking at more seasoned veterends in the industry who likley have higher positions then their younger 
                  colleagues. They would likely be family men and women. Gender gave us a 0.577 accuracy score based on our model.

                  A company less then 5 would be either startup ventures or small contractor teams that larger companies would higher.
                  Above that we would start to look at small local businesses to city-wide, state-wide, National, then international fourtune 500 companies in that order. 
                  Company size gave a negligable accuracy score so we chose to omit.

                  We right way can see that Those who have a mental health disorder and have a family of it make up a larger portion.

                  Based on the charts. We find that from the total number of men that were asked a little over half of them said that they had been previously diagnosed with a mental illness.
                  However, for women and Non-Binary individuals, more people said they had been diagnosed with a mental illness than those that didn't.

              This question aims to asnwer our orignal hypothesis before starting this project.
              The question asks if Tech companies are places that have higher chances of giving someone a mental illness, or being a place that has lot of mentally ill individuals.
              According to our model; the answer is likely a no. The accuracy score was exactly the same as self employment at 0.5759.

              The survey asked if the role of the individuals was a tech role or not in the company.
              The majority of our data said yes to the question, but as far the mental illness side the chart doesn't appear to show any correlation
              The accuracy score was exactly the same as self employment and type of company at 0.5759.

            <p style="color:black">
              Based on our data, there is definantly a large sum of individuals who work in tech that have a Mental illness, but being in that industry doesn't show to have a causal effect.
              As far as predicting Mental illness in someone,
              with our limited data it would seem like having a family history of mental illness coupled with being a women or somone who is non binary are more likely to have a mental illness.
              At least that would be the case in the tech industry. We can draw some specualtions as to why that is, there is certainly more than one possible reason for that, but that goes beyond this project.
