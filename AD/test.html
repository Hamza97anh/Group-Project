## Mental-Health-Machine-Learning
# Overview of the analysis
The analysis will be done to predict if a person working in any Tech industry has some mental illness /disorder.We are working as a team of four members and after 
researching through various web pages we finally found some data relevent to our interest in the Kaggle named as "Mental Health in the Tech Industry".
 
This data set has three different tables combined into one sqlite file. 
They are :
. The Answer table has 
four columns, Answer ID, Survey ID, User ID, Question ID, and 273 thousand rows. 
. The Question table has 
table has two columns, Question ID, and Question Text. 
. The Survey table has 
Survey ID and Description of the survey. 

-	With this data we hope to build a machine learning model that will determine if an 
individual in the Tech industry has a mental illness. We do not know if we want to determine 
depression in an individual or if we want to determine which mental illness from a list of 
anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, etc. in the mental illnesses in the data.
