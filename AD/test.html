## Mental-Health-Machine-Learning
# Overview of the analysis
The analysis will be done to predict if a person working in any Tech industry has some mental illness /disorder.We are working as a team of four members and after 
researching through various web pages we finally found some data relevent to our interest in the Kaggle named as "Mental Health in the Tech Industry" it has around 
273 thousand rows.This Database contains all information needed to do data analysis.
 
This data set has three different tables combined into one sqlite file. 
They are :
. The Answer table has four columns
 Answer ID, Survey ID, User ID, Question ID (PRIMARY/FOREIGN KEY SurveyID, PRIMARY KEY UserID, PRIMARY/FOREIGN KEY QuestionID, TEXT AnswerText). 
. The Question table has two columns
 Question ID, and Question Text(PRIMARY KEY QuestionID, TEXT QuestionText) 
. The Survey table has 
Survey ID and Description of the survey(PRIMARY KEY INT SurveyID , TEXT Description) . 

. This data  has the survey results of the  year ie (2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019).We hope to build a machine learning model with maybe one particular year and
that will determine if an individual in the Tech industry has a mental illness.
We want to determine if technology can cause mental health issues? Also, does tech industry workers having more mental health issue then other industries?
if yes, why do tech workers suffer more mental issue?
We will run supervised machine learning algorithms to predict depression in an individual or if we want to determine which mental illness from a list of 
anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, etc. in the mental illnesses in the data.

## Machine Learning Model
Python will be used to read in the data
- If we choose to determine depression, a supervised learning model or deep learning neural
network will be the best model to use because our data set has labeled data and a single outcome.
After converting the mental illness to a binary outcome we can use the logistic regression 
algorithm to predict the outcome.
- If we choose to determine any mental illness within individuals who work in Tech, a supervised
learning or neural network would also be more suitable for the question we are asking.
